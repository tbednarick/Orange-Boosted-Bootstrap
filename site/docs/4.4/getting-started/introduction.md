## Quick start

Looking to quickly add Boosted to your project? Use BootstrapCDN, provided for free by the folks at StackPath. Using a package manager or need to download the source files? [Head to the downloads page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/{{ site.docs_version }}/getting-started/download/).

### CSS

Copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets to load our CSS. You can also add `orangeHelvetica` and `orangeIcons` if needed, be careful both files are under copyright, see NOTICE.txt for more information.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.cdn.css }}" integrity="{{ site.cdn.css_hash }}" crossorigin="anonymous">
{% endhighlight %}

### JS

Many of our components require the use of JavaScript to function. Specifically, they require [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/), and our own JavaScript plugins. Place the following `<script>`s near the end of your pages, right before the closing `</body>` tag, to enable them. jQuery must come first, then Popper.js, and then our JavaScript plugins.

We use [jQuery's slim build](https://blog.jquery.com/2016/06/09/jquery-3-0-final-released/), but the full version is also supported.

{% highlight html %}
<script src="{{ site.cdn.jquery }}" integrity="{{ site.cdn.jquery_hash }}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="{{ site.cdn.popper }}" integrity="{{ site.cdn.popper_hash }}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="{{ site.cdn.tablesorter }}" integrity="{{ site.cdn.tablesorter_hash }}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="{{ site.cdn.js_swiper }}" integrity="{{ site.cdn.js_swiper_hash }}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="{{ site.cdn.js }}" integrity="{{ site.cdn.js_hash }}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

Curious which components explicitly require jQuery, our JS, and Popper.js? Click the show components link below. If you're at all unsure about the general page structure, keep reading for an example page template.

Our `boosted.bundle.js` and `boosted.bundle.min.js` include [Popper](https://popper.js.org/), and all of `boosted.js`, `boosted.min.js`, `boosted.bundle.js` and `boosted.bundle.min.js` include [focus-visible's Polyfill](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible) — but not [jQuery](https://jquery.com/). For more information about what's included in Boosted, please see our [contents]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/{{ site.docs_version }}/getting-started/contents/#precompiled-boosted) section.

#### Required script

Boosted includes a [focus-visible polyfill](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible) to ensure an enhanced focus visibility for keyboard users while shutting down focus styles on active state.
However, if you don't need or want to use Boosted's JavaScript files, you'll still need to use focus-visible.

{% endhighlight %}
{% endcapture %}
{% include callout.html content=callout type="warning" %}

## Starter template

Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards. That means using an HTML5 doctype and including a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors. Put it all together and your pages should look like this:

{% highlight html %}
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
    <title>Hello, world!</title>

    <!-- Preconnect to CDNs: remove if not needed -->
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://code.jquery.com" crossorigin="anonymous">
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com" crossorigin="anonymous">
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net" crossorigin="anonymous">

</html>
{% endhighlight %}

That's all you need for overall page requirements. Visit the [Layout docs]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/{{ site.docs_version }}/layout/overview/) or [our official examples]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/{{ site.docs_version }}/examples/) to start laying out your site's content and components.

## Important globals

Boosted employs a handful of important global styles and settings that you'll need to be aware of when using it, all of which are almost exclusively geared towards the *normalization* of cross browser styles. Let's dive in.

### HTML5 doctype

Boosted requires the use of the HTML5 doctype. Without it, you'll see some funky incomplete styling, but including it shouldn't cause any considerable hiccups.

{% highlight html %}
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

### Responsive meta tag

Boosted is developed *mobile first*, a strategy in which we optimize code for mobile devices first and then scale up components as necessary using CSS media queries. To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices, **add the responsive viewport meta tag** to your `<head>`.

{% highlight html %}
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
{% endhighlight %}

You can see an example of this in action in the [starter template](#starter-template).

### Box-sizing

For more straightforward sizing in CSS, we switch the global `box-sizing` value from `content-box` to `border-box`. This ensures `padding` does not affect the final computed width of an element, but it can cause problems with some third party software like Google Maps and Google Custom Search Engine.

On the rare occasion you need to override it, use something like the following:

{% highlight css %}
.selector-for-some-widget {
  box-sizing: content-box;
}
{% endhighlight %}

With the above snippet, nested elements—including generated content via `::before` and `::after`—will all inherit the specified `box-sizing` for that `.selector-for-some-widget`.

Learn more about [box model and sizing at CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/).

### Reboot

For improved cross-browser rendering, we use [Reboot]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/{{ site.docs_version }}/content/reboot/) to correct inconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing slightly more opinionated resets to common HTML elements.

### Ressource Hints

[Ressource hints](https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-hints/) are meant to optimize browser loading strategy, by either preloading assets, prefetching DNS or preconnecting to domains — but please use them carefully and **only to hint resources you'll really be using soon**.
It should be used for critical resources only.

#### `preload` fonts

{% highlight html %}
<link rel="preload" href="fonts/HelvNeue75_W1G.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin="anonymous">
{% endhighlight %}

#### `preconnect` to CDNs

{% highlight html %}
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://code.jquery.com" crossorigin="anonymous">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com" crossorigin="anonymous">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net" crossorigin="anonymous">
{% endhighlight %}
